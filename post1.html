<h1 id="how-i-built-my-gemini-capsule-not-a-tutorial">how i built my
gemini capsule (not a tutorial)</h1>
<h2 id="why-a-capsule-and-not-a-normal-blog">why a capsule and not a
normal blog?</h2>
<p>first, i already have this personal blog/site, where i basically put
in a bit more effort, but for messages and more <em>“intimate”</em> info
or more elaborate thoughts, <del>maybe?</del> i’m going to use my
capsule. i want to experience the internet, if you know what i mean.</p>
<h2 id="capsule-construction-process">capsule construction process</h2>
<p>well, with a homelab and the micro editor, a man can go to the moon!
<strong>that’s what my parents used to say…</strong> or not? anyway, my
focus was on having my own space on the web.</p>
<h3 id="server-problems">server problems</h3>
<p>the first problem was that the server wasn’t working; it recognized
port 1965, but couldn’t connect, saying that something was already using
the port, which wasn’t true. i opened the port through the vivo portal
(modem) and used ufw to allow the use of the port, <del>even without
really understanding how it works</del>. i used <em>agate</em> to
activate the server, but it didn’t work. later, with new tests, i
managed to activate it using <em>jetforce</em>.</p>
<p>another problem was with the ip redirection, so i had to use
<em>duckdns</em> to get a fixed ip.</p>
<h3 id="finally-its-alive-and-im-not-talking-about-the-company">finally,
IT’S ALIVE (and i’m not talking about the company)</h3>
<p>the same way <em>dr. frankenstein</em> felt seeing the monster alive,
i felt seeing my capsule alive! but, after all, why is this important?
well, because i’m dumb and having done all this by myself really made me
happy.</p>
<h2 id="homelab">homelab</h2>
<p>my capsule runs entirely with these specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>os: debian gnu/linux 13 (trixie)</li>
<li>kernel: linux 6.18.5-meson64</li>
<li>shell: bash</li>
<li>host: tanix w2 - amlogic meson s4 s905w2 ap201 reference board</li>
<li>cpu: s4 (4) (arm64)</li>
<li>gpu: amlogic meson-g12a-mali (integrated)</li>
</ul>
<p>the <em>tanix w2</em> was designed to be an android tvbox, but i
didn’t really like how it worked. so, i installed <em>debian</em> for
arm and now it’s much better than before!</p>

<hr />
<p>in this link, there is a list of all tvbox that support debian/ubuntu
arm</p>
